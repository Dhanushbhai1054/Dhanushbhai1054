#### Project: Analysis of Generation Z's career aspirations  

- **Used the 5W1H methodology to structure the analysis: Who are the respondents (Gen Z & managers), What are their aspirations, Why there is a gap, How to address it, When these aspirations evolve, and Where the divergences are most marked.
- **Standardized, cleaned, and prepared raw survey data to ensure its quality and consistency before analysis.
- **Developed key KPIs (mission-values alignment, managerial expectations, career priorities) to measure gaps and identify critical areas.
- **Designed interactive dashboards with Excel and Power BI, tailored to managers and the HR team to clearly visualize divergences in aspirations.
- **Wrote complex SQL queries to extract relevant data subsets and highlight strategic insights.
- **Delivered data-driven recommendations to bridge the gap between young talent's expectations and employers' proposals (e.g., communication, flexibility, meaningful work).
- **Deliverables used in strategic reviews with HR and management to adapt recruitment and retention policies.
